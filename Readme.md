ICSME 2020

Content: 
(i) Processed information about the sampled 385 projects for RQ1 (contains project link and detailed manual classification result),
(ii) Information about the 24 open-source projects used during the evaluation for RQ2 (contains the corresponding detailed manual classification result, the full evaluation result, and stop words lists), and 
(iii) The manually and automatically identified domain knowledge.

Under folder IdentifiedDomainKnowledge, we have a folder for each of the 24 open source projects used in RQ2.  Each folder contains two files: Concepts.txt and Relations.txt. In both of these files we identify the correct domain concept/relation as TP, wrong domain concepts/relation as FP.
